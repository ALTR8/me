          I have always loved the gym, but my workout habits have gone through many iterations.
          About two years ago I was introduced to the barbell and I fell in love. I have been hooked
          every since. I competed in my first meet in January 2017 and continue to train and compete with
          my incredible team out of Forest Hills, Queens!
